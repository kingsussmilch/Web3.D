RDF/Semantic Web Architecture
=============================

URI - Universally unique identifiers, mainly with DNS help
CURIE - URI/shortcut by namespacingbase URIs
XML - common syntax, plan text base

Web3.D uses the idea of bringing 3 dimensions into the web to expand the capacity of a simple search enjine in order
find a wider selection of search results. It uses RDF(Resource Description Framework)/XML(Xtensible
Markup Language), Turtle and N3. It also uses RDFa embeddded in the (X)HTML. 

RDF is loaded using GRDDL(Glenaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages)which defines XSL importers for 
antoligy, doctype or file. OWL(Web Ontology Language) implemented in RIF(Rule Interchange Format) finds the
"rules" for descovering triplets.
