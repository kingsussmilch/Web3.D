Web3.D
======

Currently sites rely on search engines to provide access to their hard to reach pages. This searches are prone to 
misunderstanding and relies on an index which can get out of date. We provide an innovative alternative. WebGL meets RDF!
It renders your pages and their relationships on a gorgeously 3D sphere (for maximum visibility of content) and links 
them. 

And yes, for these times you can't see what you want immediately, we provide search. But we'll innovate! For those times
you want something exact, we'll give you a special gridded precise search control. If you don't know what you want, 
searching for keywords brings up a "word globe".

Web3.D may get a slow start as @kingsussmilch, it's manager, is learning the necessary technologies under the mentorship 
of @alcinnz.
